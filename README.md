# Config:
Configuration is done in the root of your lovelace configuration.

Example:
```yaml
swipe_nav:
  wrap: false
  animate: swipe
  skip_tabs: 5,6,7,8
  prevent_default: true
  swipe_amount: 30
  
views:
```

**Config Options:**<br>

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| swipe_amount | number | 15 | Minimum percent of screen needed to be swiped in order to navigate.
| skip_tabs | string | | A comma seperated list of views to skip when swiping. e.g., `1,3,5`.
| skip_hidden | boolean | true | Automatically skips hidden tabs.
| wrap | boolean | true | Wrap from first tab to last tab and vice versa.
| prevent_default | boolean | false | Prevents the browsers default horizontal swipe actions.  (Please note, on a tablet, you will need to shut down your browser and restart/reload your UI before this option will take effect.)
| animate | string |  | Swipe animations. Can be: `swipe`, `fade`, `flip`. The swipe animation should be considered experimental and depending on your setup may appear buggy.
